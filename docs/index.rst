Your First Steps at TACC
=============================

The workshop is designed to introduce skills required to perform computational
research in domain sciences. It will provide an overview of essential tasks 
related to utilizing TACC resources effectively. This workshop is intended for
people who have little to no experience with a command line interface, but intend
to use a Linux workstation or HPC cluster for domain science research.

This workshop will be fully interactive. Participants are **strongly encouraged** to follow along on the command line.

In this workshop, we use:

.. code-block:: console

   [local]$

for commands on the local system and:

.. code-block:: console

   [frontera]$ 
   
for commands on the remote system consistently throughout.
