Your First Steps at TACC
=============================

The workshop is designed to introduce skills required to perform computational
research in domain sciences. It will cover topics in the Linux command line interface,
the text editor VIM, and high performance computing. This workshop is intended for
people who have little to no experience with a command line interface, but intend
to use a Linux workstation or HPC cluster for domain science research.
